Footflow helps small businesses track how many people visit the store and how many make purchases. It uses a door sensor to count foot traffic and compares it with sales data uploaded as a CSV file. The app processes the data and shows graphs to make the numbers easy to understand.

Foot Traffic vs Sales
- Compares the number of visitors to the number of sales
- Helps you see how many people buy versus walk out
- New Feature Added: Allows you to select a specific date

Popular Payment Methods
- Shows which payment methods (like cash or card) customers use most

Popular Items Sold
- Shows which items sell the most overall, and weekly (new feature).

Average Items Per Order

How It Works
- Upload Your Data: Add a CSV file with daily sales info.
- Analyze Data: The app processes the CSV and matches it with foot traffic data  from the door sensor.
